# PyBer_Analysis
Ride-Share data analysis using Pandas, SciPy, NumPy, and Matplotlib 

## Overview 
This analysis explores the differences in fares, driver numbers, and number of trips between cities. The cities are divided into Urban, Suburban, and Rural categories.

## Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. 
Overall, Urban cities have the most rides and drivers, with lowest fares, while rural cities have the fewest rides and drivers, with the highest fares. Suburban cities fall in the middle.

The highest number of rides in a rural city does is less than the minimum number in an urban city.

The difference in fares is not as extreme and there is overlap between all city types.

## Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
The majority of business comes from urban cities. Reccomendations:
- Higher fares for rural areas to balances out the fewer rides. Same for suburban areas, to a lesser extent
- Less coverage in rural areas - less need for ride-sharing in rural areas
- More support in Urban cities, since the majority of business comes from there.
